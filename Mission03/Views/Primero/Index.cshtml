    <!-- What I want to get out of IS 413 -->
    <p class="para">In IS 413, I hope to learn how to make a full web app using ASP.NET. Furthermore, I hope to be able to make the web app have CRUD and search functionality. I want to have experience with connecting the web app to a database and deploying the web app. I also would like to learn how to make my web app interact with other websites. Additionally, I will learn how to implement machine learning in my web app.</p>
